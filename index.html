          worship, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Nice building as well. Almost directly opposite Mother's House so fo both
          at the same time</p>

        <p class="text-muted">School Library Journal (SLJ) is an American monthly magazine containing reviews and other
          articles for school librarians, media specialists, and public librarians who work with young people. Articles
          cover a wide variety of topics, with a focus on technology, multimedia, and other information resources that
          are
          likely to interest young learners. Reviews are classified by the target audience of the publications:
          preschool;
          schoolchildren to 4th grade, grades 5 and up, and teens; and professional librarians themselves ("professional
          reading"). Fiction, non-fiction, and reference books books are reviewed, as are graphic novels, multimedia,
          and
          digital resources</p>

        <hr>
        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">was build in 1982</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">It was a decent enough auditorium for watching plays or shows. All the seats have a
          wonderful view. The sound system was reasonably good. There is ample parking, but still better to reach a little early to avoid delays
          due to congestion at the parking area. Overall a great place to watch a show</p>
